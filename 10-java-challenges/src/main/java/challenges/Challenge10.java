	 * 10. PRIME FACTORIZATION The prime factors of a number are all of the integers
	 * below that number that are divisible into the number as well as 1. For
	 * example, the prime factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6, and 12.
	 * 
	 * Create a prime factorization calculator that returns the prime factors of any
	 * number between 2 and 100. If you're looking for a more advanced version of
	 * this challenge, use exercise 9 to create a prime factorization calculator for
	 * any number. Hint: think about using square roots to cut your work in half.
